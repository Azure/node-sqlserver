Microsoft Driver for Node.js for SQL Server

To build and use the Microsoft Driver for Node.js for SQL Server, you
will need to:

1) Install node-gyp.
   npm install -g node-gyp

2) Configure project from the root of node-sqlserver.
   node-gyp configure

3) (If using Visual C++ Express 2010) convert sqlserver.sln to
   VC2010.
   The default VC2008 projects generated by node-gyp will not
   compile with Visual Studio Express because of a missing stdint.h

4) Build using node-gyp, Visual Studio or msbuild.
   node-gyp build or msbuild /p:Configuration=Debug|Release

5) Copy the sqlserver.node file over to the lib directory.
   sqlserver.node will be in build/<Configuration> (Debug
   or Release) directory.

You can test the build by running the tests as such:

cd tests
node runtests.js
